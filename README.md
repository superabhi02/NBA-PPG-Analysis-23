# NBA-PPG-Predictors-2022-23

This R project explores the 2022-2023 NBA season data to identify the key factors that contribute to individual players' points per game (PPG). Through data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization, the project focuses on revealing insights into how various player statistics correlate with scoring performance.

## Key Features:
- **Player Attributes**: Investigating how factors like field goal percentage, assists, rebounds, and usage rate affect PPG.
- **Statistical Methods**: Regression models to predict PPG based on selected player features.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different metrics and PPG using correlation tests.
- **Visualization**: Using `ggplot2` for visualizing trends and patterns in player performance.

## Technologies Used:
- R (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr)
- Statistical Methods: Correlation analysis, regression models

## Goals:
To understand the statistical relationships that drive individual scoring performance and provide actionable insights for players, coaches, and analysts in the NBA.
